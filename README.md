The inspiration behind building this platform stemmed from a deep-seated belief in the power of democratizing technology. Witnessing the transformative potential of artificial intelligence, I was driven by the desire to make this cutting-edge technology accessible to everyone, irrespective of their technical background.
This App help anyone to build chatbot on top of any data and these chatbots later used as a consultants for information gathering by doctors if they want to heard by the bot built by some famous doctor, similary for engineers or even for uneducated people who don't know read and write but they can talk and listen.
yes this functionality is possible because of google text to speech and speech functions.
